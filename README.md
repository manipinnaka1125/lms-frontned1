**note: we have stoped the backend deployment due to the cost so if you want to run our lms you can clone and run it 



for testing purpose of the lms
go to login --> first login as admin 
email:admin@example.com
password:admin123
role:admin

we can add the students,instructors
we can also add the courses and also assign courses 

after adding all the students,instructors,courses,assigncourses

login as student we will get the otp to our mail 
when we enter otp only we we will enter into the student dashboard and for instructor also same 
 we can see our courses and all the courses and also our material 

in instructor he can add the courses
The team Members involved are 
 P.Mani Swaroop (Team Lead)
 V.Lokesh

 so basically we have done the project lms(learning management system)
where we basically have 3 roles admin,student,instructor

what we can do it means 

in the admin dashboard we can add the students,instructors,courses and also we can assign the courses properly

if we want to login as student or the instructor firstly u have to add in the admin dashboard there is 6-digit otp verification

frontend is built using the react and backend (springboot) database-->mysql

we have deployed the frontend in netlify and backend in the railway.app 
 

you can contribute to our project you can do all the enhancements lots of love ..
